The once popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.com was  more than 2 days 
offline.

Since noon today (Saturday 1/13/18) it is online again.

In the recent past, the ageing exchange has had a tremendous impact on
scaling problems, which led to the development of a new trading engine.
This should now be activated on thursday - planned with 2 hours downtime. 

This must have taken a little longer:

The creation of new accounts and withdrawal from Exchange accounts
are currently deactivated - otherwise the accessibility seems to be good again. 
However, further disturbances are still to be expected.

As compensation, trading on the exchange should be free of charge until the end of January.
(except margin trading).
