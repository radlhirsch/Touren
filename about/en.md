## Hello,

my name is **Marco Stolze**. 

I'm currently working as a **software architect** / systems engineer for a 
manufacturer of medical devices. 

My place of residence and work is **Berlin**, Germany.

### Profession

I made my first experiences in software development already in the 80's with 
small BASIC-programmed routines.
At the beginning of the 90's I extended my experience with C, C++, Delphi, 
Java - but also with exotics like Prolog or Assembler.
For a long time I worked as a VB and **Delphi** programmer.
When the .NET framework with **C#** was released, I also started to switch to this
platform and language, which still dominates my professional work today.

Agile organizational methodologies such as **SCRUM** or Kanban are 
a matter of course for me - but I am also familiar with PRINCE2 for corporate 
projects.

In my profession it is very important to have a profound knowledge of 
**software architectures and design**, **patterns and best practices** as well 
as the ability to technically organize and document development processes.

### Interests

As an universalist, I'm constantly improving my knowledge of many other 
development platforms such as **NodeJS**, JavaScript (**Typescript**, Coffeescript), 
Java, Ruby, Go.
 

On these personal github pages I would like to share my thoughts on interesting 
topics, such as software development, **blockchain** and **cryptocurrencies**, 
**deep learning**, **big/smart data**, photography etc. and describe my own projects.
